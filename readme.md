# Brief-Case
Brief-Case provides users with a daily provincial and national COVID-19 summaries with live news coverage. 

- This program uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to parse data from <a href = "https://api.covid19tracker.ca/docs/1.0/overview" target = "_blank" rel = "covid19API">COVID-19 Tracker Canada</a> and <a href = "https://newsapi.org/" target = "_blank" rel = "newsAPI">News API</a> with the Fetch API. 
- Only JavaScript was used in this project to ensure that a solid foundation was formed, prior to moving on to other frameworks such as React. 

## Inspiration and Future Plans
This idea started as an incomplete hackathon project, and I decided that I would tackle this project on my own to refine and add more functionality to the web application. In this code sample, my main goal was to master the Fetch API and JavaScript syntax before going deeper into React and similar frameworks. Furthermore, I gained a deeper understanding of the use-cases of various for loops, such as the For-In loop, as I did not have much prior knowledge.


In the future, I plan on creating a server to host these APIs in an attempt to deploy them onto GitHub Pages, as they are only allowed to be run in localhost currently. I will also come back to this to clean up any unnecessary clutter in my code. 

## Running the Program
1.  Pull this repository
2.  Open the project in your desired code editor
3.  Run ```npx serve``` in the terminal
4.  View it on localhost
